What is Mailosaur?
Mailosaur is a service that captures email and SMS messages and lets you test them, both via it’s web dashboard and via the Mailosaur testing API.

If you don’t already have one, create a free account trial now, and send an email into Mailosaur first. Once you have this working, you’re ready to start testing!
